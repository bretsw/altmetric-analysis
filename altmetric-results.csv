Providing computing experiences for K-12 students with and without disabilities can open the doors to multiple career paths and provide broad educational benefits. Computing education may involve either linear progression through discrete computing skills with tutorial software that teaches computing (e.g., Code.org or the Khan Academy) or open exploration/inquiry where students and their teachers use programming software for their instructional purposes. Younger students often begin learning computing (i.e., how to use a computer) and programming (i.e., how to code) with graphically intuitive tile-based software such as the open-source software Scratch. Older students may begin with these same programs or learn how to program within professional programming languages such as Java or Python. There are many strategies special educators can employ to increase opportunities for students with learning disabilities to succeed in computing education. This article presents several strategies and resources that special educators can implement to support students who find computing challenging.

This article discusses three ways in which teachers can incorporate multiple representations within multiplication instruction to develop a deep understanding of underlying mathematical structures. First, it is important to select concrete and semi-concrete representations (e.g., discrete objects and those that illustrate continuous quantities as length or area) that will help students most accurately model the multiplication or division concept or procedure. Next, provide students with multiple representations that are presented concurrently within the same lesson so that they can make connections among the different types of representations. Last, teachers can support students to use and connect representations through mathematical discourse that elicits student thinking by not only structuring tasks around three processes, reversibility, flexibility, and generalization, but also by posing questions to elicit different ways that students can communicate their ideas using accurate and precise vocabulary.

Numerous research studies have been published that address a variety of topics using task analytic instruction (eg, math word problems [Browder, Jimenez, & Trela, 2012], scientific inquiry [Courtade, Browder, & Spooner, 2010], homework completion [Hampshire, Butera, & Bellini, 2011], and vocational assembly training [Lee & Singer-Dudek, 2012]).

"Ford, J. W., Kern, A. M. Gorman, J. P., & Mooney, C. D.",Time Is of the Essence: Individualizing Academic Intervention for Students of Transition Age,2023,Teaching Exceptional Children,NA,NA,NA,"Individualizing instruction is a time-consuming aspect of classroom practice. Testing multiple interventions, and monitoring each to see which is most effective for a student can be prohibitively time consuming. However, Brief Experimental Analysis (BEA) is an assessment procedure that can be used to quickly identify an intervention that is likely to be successful with an individual student. BEA provides teachers with a method to efficiently collect data and predict which intervention is most likely to be successful before a significant amount of time and resources are invested. The BEA process can be used with students at a variety of grade levels for the purpose of academic and behavior intervention. This paper describes how to implement BEA in reading with students with intellectual disabilities in order to prepare them for opportunities in postsecondary education. We will also discuss how to overcome hurdles that practitioners may experience implementing the process.

At the intersection of exceptionality and race, twice exceptional students from racially minoritized communities may experience behavioral difficulties in schools. In this article, we provide information for educators as well as school and district administrators about the unique challenges and possibilities in teaching 2e students of color. We offer a research-based collective problem-solving process, Learning Lab, that brings together practitioners, students, school and district leaders, families, and community members, especially those who have been excluded from schools’ decision-making activities. Learning Lab members engage in root cause analyses, map out their existing behavioral support system, and design a culturally responsive school wide behavioral support model in response to experiences, resources, needs, and goals of 2e students and their school contexts. In Learning Labs, the local school community has power in determining the future of their school. Practitioners, students, family and community members’ diverse histories and interests are utilized to develop just, effective, and gifted schools for all.
